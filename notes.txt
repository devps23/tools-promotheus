to run the service in specific working directory(means current directory to specific directory)
Ex:once started service some where files are stored but not in specific directory(like prometheus)
so add "WorkingDirectory=/usr/local" in service file
in this file
WorkingDirectory=/opt/prometheus-{{ version }}.linux-amd64
go and check in linux server whether service started or not
suppose we get permisssion denied error : means the Prometheus uanrchive is under ec2-user owner.so here user is bin.
under bin ,service is running.so change the owner from ec2-user to bin
manually do in server:
======================
chown bin(user):bin(group) /opt/prometheus-{{ version }}.linux-amd64

through automation , to change ownership use below
"owner:bin" ---to change current user to bin user
these permisions allow in unarchive module.

Note:to run the service under the specific tool only

prometheus is a tool to run the service under prometheus only so add "WorkingDirectory=/opt/prometheus-{{ version }}.linux-amd64"
in service file
